title: SUMOSIM training
description: |
  Sumosim is a simulation for sumo robots. Two robots are
  placed on a circular field. Each of them tries to push
  the opponent out of the field. Winner is who stays longer
  in the field.

  Sumosim is inspired by [Robot-sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo)

  description: |
    Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm
    that teaches an agent to assign values to each action it
    might take, conditioned on the agent being in a
    particular state. It does not require a model of the environment
    (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic
    transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations. [wiki]
