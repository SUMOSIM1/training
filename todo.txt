calculate reward from recorded game infos for a robot. with testcases
    for winning n = 1
        by doing nothing. the opponent walked out +5
        by pushing the opponent out +20
    for loosing n = 1
        by unforced walking out of the field -20
        by being pushed out by the opponent -10
    for pushing the opponent n >= 0
        while seeing it +10
        while not seeing it 0
    for being pushed n >= 0
        while seeing the opponent -10
        while not seeing the opponent 0

    reward is always >= 0

    helper functions:
    canSeeTheOpponent(myStatus, opponentStatus): Option[distance]
    findColissions(): List[(myStatus, opponetStaus)]
    findEnd(): (myStatus, opponetStaus) <- One of them should be out (the looser)
